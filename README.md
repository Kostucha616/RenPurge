# RenPurge
tl;dr kill compiled renpy code files

A quick & dirty solution to unbork a Renpy project folder if you're jumping branches / renaming / moving files alot

Cleans up all the compiled code & other garbage

Optionally, persistent data & empty dirs

Meant to be used as a one-stop .exe <b>ran from 'project\game'</b>, can be found in releases
